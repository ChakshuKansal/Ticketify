## Application Flow

### 1. **Authentication**
   - **User Registration**: Users can register with their email and password. Email verification ensures valid registration.
   - **JWT-based Authentication**: After registration, users log in using their credentials. A JWT token is generated for secure access.
   - **Protected Route Handling**: Certain routes, such as booking tickets or event management, are protected and require JWT authentication to access.

### 2. **Content Management**
   - **Event Creation**: Event organizers can create new events, providing details such as event name, description, location, price, and schedule.
   - **Image Upload and Management**: Organizers can upload images for events. These images are stored and displayed alongside event details.
   - **Tag System for Categorization**: Events are categorized with tags such as "Music," "Theater," or "Workshop" to help users filter and find relevant events.

### 3. **User Interactions**
   - **Ticket Booking System**: Users can browse events and book tickets. They can view ticket availability, prices, and event details before making a booking.
   - **Event Subscription**: Users can subscribe to newsletters or event updates to stay informed about new events or important changes.
